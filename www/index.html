<p>Rawrite32 is a tool to prepare disks or other removeable media,
especially USB memory sticks, from files called
<b>file system images</b>. These images are usualy prepared with a NetBSD 
system already
setup or downloaded from the official release (or NetBSD-daily snapshot
server) and are utilized in various ways (depending on the port of NetBSD) to
bootstrap a new installation.
</p><p>
You can download the file system images via the internet and move the contents
onto appropriate media for your machine using this utility program.<p>
Rawrite32 runs on any kind of Win32 system, but on ancient systems (Windows 95
upto Windows ME) has some restrictions.
</p><p>
You may use Rawrite32 for free, it is 2-clause BSD licensed, see the <a href="license.html">license</a>
for details.

<p><b>August 2, 2010: New Version 1.0.2.0 out:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:2.5em">After a long time, Rawrite32 has been adapted to newer windows versions
and their restrictions on administratie use.
<br>More hash calculations have
been added and bzip2 compressed images are supported now.
<br>Main focus
has switched from targetting floppy drives (do you remember those?) to USB
devices/memory sticks.
<br>
The program has been translated into german and japanese <i>(thanks to
Izumi Tsutsui, also for a lot of beta-testing!)</i>.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:4ex">Old changes:</p>
<p>November 18, 2003: New Version 1.0.1.3 out<br>
Thanks to Richard Dorsch a bug in decompressing files with compression rates
&gt; 1:10 has been fixed.</p>
<p>Version 1.0.1.2 fixed a bug in handling odd sized images, like the latest
memtest86 ones that do not contain multiples of the floppy sector size.</p>
