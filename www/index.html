<p>
Rawrite32 is a tool to prepare disks or other removeable media,
especially USB memory sticks, from files called
<b>file system images</b>. These images are usualy prepared with a NetBSD 
system already
setup or downloaded from the official release (or NetBSD-daily snapshot
server) and are utilized in various ways (depending on the port of NetBSD) to
bootstrap a new installation.<p>
You can download the file system images via the internet and move the contents
onto appropriate media for your machine using this utility program.<p>
Rawrite32 runs on any kind of Win32 system, but on ancient system (Windows 95
upto Windows ME) has some restrictions.<p>
You may use Rawrite32 for free, see the <a href="license.html">license</a>
for details.<p>
The documentation is included with the program, but you may preview it
<a href="help/rawrite32-en.htm">online</a>.<p>
Finaly, if you would like to get the program, just download it
<a href="download.html">here</a>.
<h3>July 30, 2010: New Version 1.0.2.0 out</h3>
<p>After a long time, Rawrite32 has been adapted to newer windows versions
and their restrictions on administratie use. More hash calculations have
been added and bzip2 compressed images are supported now. Main focus
has switched from targetting floppy drives (do you remember those?) to USB
devices/memory sticks.</p>
<h3>November 18, 2003: New Version 1.0.1.3 out</h3>
Thanks to Richard Dorsch a bug in decompressing files with compression rates
&gt; 1:10 has been fixed.<p>
Old changes:<p>
Version 1.0.1.2 fixed a bug in handling odd sized images, like the latest
memtest86 ones that do not contain multiples of the floppy sector size.
