The source for Rawrite32 consists of multiple parts:
  - the "real" Rawrite32 source files
  - some files from the NetBSD tree, redistributed unmodified
    in the NetBSD subdirectory
  - the zlib and bz2lib sources, which have to be extracted
    from their own distribution into the zlib and bz2lib directory.
